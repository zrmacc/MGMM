\usage{
rGMM(n, d = 2, k = 1, pi = NULL, miss = 0, means = NULL, covs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Observations (rows).}

\item{d}{Observation dimension (columns).}

\item{k}{Number of mixture components. Defaults to 1.}

\item{pi}{Mixture proportions. If omitted, components are assumed
equi-probable.}

\item{miss}{Proportion of elements missing, \eqn{miss\in[0,1)}.}

\item{means}{Either a prototype mean vector, or a list of mean vectors. Defaults
to the zero vector.}

\item{covs}{Either a prototype covariance matrix, or a list of covariance
matrices. Defaults to the identity matrix.}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix with observations as rows. Row numbers specify the
  true cluster assignments.
}
\description{
Generates an \eqn{n\times d} matrix of multivariate normal random vectors
with observations as rows. If \eqn{k=1}, all observations belong to the same
cluster. If \eqn{k>1} the observations are generated via two-step precoedure.
First, the cluster membership is drawn from a multinomial distribution, with
mixture proportions specified by \code{pi}. Conditional on cluster
membership, the observation is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution,
with cluster-specific mean and covariance. The cluster means are provided
using \code{M}, and the cluster covariance matrices are provided using
\code{covs}. If \eqn{m>0}, missingness is introduced, completely at random, by
setting that proportion of elements in the data matrix to \code{NA}.
